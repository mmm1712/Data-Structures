# Data-Structures
my projects in Data Structures with C++ class at Santa Monica College

Assignment 1 - the program implements an interface for a simple Abstract Data Type (ADT) called Container that acts like an array

Assignment 2 - the assignment requires extending an abstract class, implementing virtual functions, and creating a templated class in C++ to create an Items type

Assignment 3 - the assignment requires implementing a sorted IntArray class in C++ that supports various operations such as insertion, removal, sorting, and searching, and comparing the runtime of an O(n^2) sorting algorithm with the STL's O(nlogn) sorting algorithm

Assignment 4 - this programming assignment involves implementing a templated doubly linked list, a stack and a queue using the linked list, and includes operations such as insertion, removal, and intersection/union of lists, as well as implementing a postfix calculator and palindrome checker

Assignment 5 - this programming assignment involves implementing a priority queue using a doubly-linked list or the standard template library list type, a vector-based min heap, and an unbalanced binary search tree, and includes benchmarking and runtime analysis of different data structures
